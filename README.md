# Chess-Winner-Determiner

## Description

Python program I wrote during my first year.

The user enters the status of their current chessboard, and the program decides if there is winner or not. Then, they are able to move their players and re-evaluate the status of the board.

## Usage

To use, simply download the git repository and cd into the file. The program can be run with the following command:

`python chess_winner.py`
